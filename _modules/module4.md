description: "Environmental phenomena, including carbon cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes, are often driven by multiple factors that interact across space and over time. In this module, students "force" a lake model with climate scenarios to test hypotheses about how local and global drivers interact to promote or suppress greenhouse gas."
