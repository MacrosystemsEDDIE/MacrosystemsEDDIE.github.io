image: /images/module3.jpg
description: "Ecosystems can be influenced via teleconnections, in which meteorological, societal, and/or ecological changes in one region affect climate and associated ecological responses in a distant region. In this module, students will explore how distant drivers interact with local lake characteristics to affect water temperatures and ice cover in different lakes."
